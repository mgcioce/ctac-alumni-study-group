### Stuff to do to prepare for first session:
I've already picked the topic I want to do (data structures and algorithms), so what I need to do is build a dependency graph of what topics I need to go over in order to have it make sense to people.

I think the best thing to do is to pick the topic for the first meeting and what the problem is going to be, and from there I can build a dependency graph on what people need to know in order to master that topic.

The first thing we should talk about are arrays, then lists (list being an abstract data type). We should also talk about what a data structure is/ what a data type is.

Stuff that we need to go over:
1) functions
2) functional programming
3) recursion
4) computer programming paradigms - input, processing, output
5) abstraction and modularity
6)
